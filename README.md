ESPHome Addressable RGB Tester
==============================

Small tool to run ESPHome AddressableRGB lambas on, to test.

```
ARGB_LAMBDA="Christmas.txt" SLEEP_MS=100 CHAIN_LENGTH=50 ./run.sh
```

You'll need a terminal with full RGB support.

If this doesnt replicate how your LEDs look IRL, that is a bug, please report.
